# C Coding Standard

C coding standard.

## Formatting

### Spaces horizontal

End of line comments shall be separated from the code by 4 spaces.

```c
int i = 0;    /* End of line comment separated from the code by 4 spaces. */
```

#### Pros

Separation with spaces emphazises the distinction between the actual code and the comment, resulting in a slight improvment of readability.

#### Cons

The extra spaces will leave less space for the comment, but this issue can be resolved by moving the comment above the code or make the comment multi-line.
