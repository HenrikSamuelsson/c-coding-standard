# Rule 8 - Restrict Type Qualifier

The `restrict` type qualifier shall not be used.

## Non-compliant

```c
void f(size_t *restrict p1, size_t *restrict p2, size_t *restrict val)
{
    *ptrA += *val;
    *ptrB += *val;
}
```

## Compliant

```c
void f(size_t *p1, size_t *p2, size_t *val)
{
    *ptrA += *val;
    *ptrB += *val;
}
```

## Rationale

By using restrict type qualifier, more efficient code can be generated by the compiler. However, the use of restrict type qualifier will require the programmer to guarantee that the targeted areas will not overlap to avoid undefined behaviour, and there is a risk involved because the compiler will not output an error.
