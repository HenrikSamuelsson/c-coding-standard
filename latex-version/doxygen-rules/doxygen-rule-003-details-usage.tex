\subsection*{\doxygenRule{}}

A Doxygen comment block used for documenting a function can in addition to the \textbackslash brief section have a section with more detailed description of the functionality. This section shall be annotated with the \textbackslash details command. The \textbackslash details section shall follow below the \textbackslash brief section. There shall be an empty line both before and after the \textbackslash details section.

\subsubsection*{Examples}

\noindent
\begin{minipage}[t]{0.47\textwidth}
    \lstinputlisting[
        xleftmargin = 3.4pt,
        firstline = 6,
        lastline = 15,
        title = {Non-Compliant}
    ]{../code/doxy-rules/doxy-rule-003-non-compliant.c}
\end{minipage}\hfill
\begin{minipage}[t]{0.47\textwidth}
    \lstinputlisting[
        xrightmargin = 3.4pt,
        firstline = 6,
        lastline = 18,
        title = {Compliant}
    ]{../code/doxy-rules/doxy-rule-003-compliant.c}
\end{minipage}

\subsubsection*{Reasoning}

The \textbackslash brief section shall be short so there is sometimes a need to have additional function documentation in a followup section, this is where the \textbackslash details section comes into play.

The \textbackslash details annotation is strictly not needed because Doxygen will implicitly use a section following the \textbackslash brief section as the detailed function documentation. But explicitly stating that this is the detailed documentation makes it more clear what is placed in this section.
