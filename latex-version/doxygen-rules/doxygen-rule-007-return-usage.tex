\subsection*{\doxygenRule{}}

Function Doxygen comment blocks shall use the \textbackslash return command to document what the function returns. Functions that do not return a value shall be documented with the description "Void.".

\subsubsection*{Examples}

\noindent
\begin{minipage}[t]{0.48\textwidth}
    \lstinputlisting[
        xleftmargin = 3.4pt,
        firstline = 4,
        lastline = 14,
        title = {Non-Compliant}
    ]{../code/doxy-rules/doxy-rule-007-non-compliant.c}

\end{minipage}\hfill
\begin{minipage}[t]{0.48\textwidth}
    \lstinputlisting[
        xrightmargin = 3.4pt,
        firstline = 4,
        lastline = 14,
        title = {Compliant}
    ]{../code/doxy-rules/doxy-rule-007-compliant.c}
\end{minipage}

\subsubsection*{Reasoning}

The Doxygen \textbackslash return command is useful due that it ensures that the value returned by a function will have documentation, can be especially helpful when using an function written by other developers.

Using the description "Void." for functions that do not return anything is mostly a convention to explicitly indicate that the return value have not been missed out in the documentation.
