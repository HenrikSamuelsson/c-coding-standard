\subsection*{\doxygenRule{}}

A Doxygen comment block for a function shall use the \textbackslash param command for each function parameter also include the direction attribute as well as an description.

\subsubsection*{Examples}

\noindent
\begin{minipage}[t]{0.47\textwidth}
    \lstinputlisting[
        xleftmargin = 3.4pt,
        firstline = 11,
        lastline = 13,
        title = {Non-Compliant}
    ]{../code/doxy-rule-001.c}
     \lstinputlisting[
        xleftmargin = 3.4pt,
        firstline = 15,
        lastline = 17,
        title = {Non-Compliant}
    ]{../code/doxy-rule-001.c}
    \lstinputlisting[
        xleftmargin = 3.4pt,
        firstline = 19,
        lastline = 21,
        title ={Non-Compliant}
    ]{../code/doxy-rule-001.c}
\end{minipage}\hfill
\begin{minipage}[t]{0.47\textwidth}
    \lstinputlisting[
        xrightmargin = 3.4pt,
        firstline = 5,
        lastline = 7,
        title = {Compliant}
    ]{../code/doxy-rule-001.c}
\end{minipage}


\subsubsection*{Reasoning}

Doxygen supports multiple different formats for the comments block that is the base for the documentation generation. A single format shall be used in a project to improve source code readability. What format to use is somewhat arbitrary.

The format specified by this rule is chosen due to that it closely resembles ordinary C comment blocks. Many editors will understand that this is a Doxygen comment block and highlight the block accordingly, and it is also understood and formatted correctly by many automatic source code formatting tools.
