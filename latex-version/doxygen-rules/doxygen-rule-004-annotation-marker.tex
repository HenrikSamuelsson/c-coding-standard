\subsection*{\doxygenRule{}}

Doxygen annotation commands shall start with a backslash.

\subsubsection*{Examples}

\noindent
\begin{minipage}[t]{\codelstwidth\textwidth}
    \lstinputlisting[
        xleftmargin = 3.4pt,
        firstline = 3,
        lastline = 5,
        title = {Non-Compliant}
    ]{../code/doxy-rules/doxy-rule-004-non-compliant.c}
\end{minipage}\hfill
\begin{minipage}[t]{\codelstwidth\textwidth}
    \lstinputlisting[
        xrightmargin = 3.4pt,
        firstline = 3,
        lastline = 5,
        title = {Compliant}
    ]{../code/doxy-rules/doxy-rule-004-compliant.c}
\end{minipage}


\subsubsection*{Reasoning}

Doxygen accepts two different styles for how to write the annotation commands. A command can start with either a backslash or the at-symbol.
The backslash is chosen to be used because this symbol is part of the basic character set. It is desirable to have the entire source code base written using only characters from the basic character set due that it minimizes the risk of problems with portability and usage of various tools.
