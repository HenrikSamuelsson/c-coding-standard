\subsection*{\doxygenRule{}}

A source code file with Doxygen annotations shall hold an initial Doxygen comment block where the first command shall be the \textbackslash file command followed by the name of the file.

\subsubsection*{Examples}

The examples assumes that name of the file where the comment block resides is main.c.

\noindent
\begin{minipage}[t]{\codelstwidth\textwidth}
    \lstinputlisting[
        xleftmargin = 3.4pt,
        firstline = 1,
        lastline = 3,
        title = {Non-Compliant}
    ]{../code/doxy-rules/doxy-rule-005-non-compliant.c}
\end{minipage}\hfill
\begin{minipage}[t]{\codelstwidth\textwidth}
    \lstinputlisting[
        xrightmargin = 3.4pt,
        firstline = 1,
        lastline = 3,
        title = {Compliant}
    ]{../code/doxy-rules/doxy-rule-005-compliant.c}
\end{minipage}

\subsubsection*{Reasoning}

Doxygen will, assuming default settings, only run the documentation process of global objects in a file if the file itself is marked as to be documented. This means that more or less all source files constructed in a project should include the \textbackslash file command at the top of the file.
