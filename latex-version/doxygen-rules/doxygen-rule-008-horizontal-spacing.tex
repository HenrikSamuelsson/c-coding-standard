    \lstinputlisting[
        xleftmargin = 3.4pt,
        firstline = 5,
        lastline = 17,
        title = {Non-Compliant}
    ]{../code/doxy-rules/doxy-rule-008-non-compliant.c}
\end{minipage}\hfill
\begin{minipage}[t]{\codelstwidth\textwidth}
    \lstinputlisting[
        xrightmargin = 3.4pt,
        firstline = 5,
        lastline = 20,
        title = {Compliant}
    ]{../code/doxy-rules/doxy-rule-008-compliant.c}
\end{minipage}
