\subsection*{\myRule{}}

Us an enum to define a set of related constants.

\subsubsection*{Examples}

TODO Add code examples.
TODO Check if GCC spots the problem in the non-compliant code example.

\subsubsection{Reasoning}

Defining related constants as enum type, as opposed to a group of preprocessor defines, makes it possible to automate checks for errors where the constant is used in the wrong context.

Simplifies debugging due to that there will be a symbol for each enum constant in the debugger symbol table.
