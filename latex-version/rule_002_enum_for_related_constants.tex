\subsection{Related Constants Definition}

Us an enum to define related constants.

\subsection{Examples}

TODO Add code examples.
TODO Check if GCC spots the problem in the non-compliant code example.

\subsubsection{Reasoning}

Defining related constants as enum type, as opposed to a group of preprocessor defines, makes it possible to automate checks for errors where the constant is used in the wrong context.

Also so will eventual debugging be simplified due to that there will for sure be a symbol for each enum constant in the debugger symbol table.
