\subsection*{\doxygenRule{}}

A doxygen comment block used for documenting a function can in addition to the  \textbackslash brief section have one or more sections with more detailed description of the functionality. Each section of this type be shall annotated with the \textbackslash details command.

\subsubsection*{Examples}

\noindent
\begin{minipage}[t]{0.47\textwidth}
    \lstinputlisting[
        xleftmargin = 3.4pt,
        firstline = 11,
        lastline = 13,
        title = {Non-Compliant}
    ]{../code/doxy-rule-001.c}
\end{minipage}\hfill
\begin{minipage}[t]{0.47\textwidth}
    \lstinputlisting[
        xrightmargin=3.4pt,
        firstline=5,
        lastline=7,
        title={Compliant}
    ]{../code/doxy-rule-001.c}
\end{minipage}

\noindent
\begin{minipage}[t]{0.47\textwidth}

        xleftmargin=3.4pt,
        firstline=15,

\subsubsection*{Reasoning}

Doxygen supports multiple different formats for the comments block that is the base for the documentation generation. A single format shall be used in a project to improve source code readability. What format to use is somewhat arbitrary.

The format specified by this rule is chosen due to that it closely resembles ordinary C comment blocks. Many editors will understand that this is a Doxygen comment block and highlight the block accordingly, and it is also understood and formatted correctly by many automatic source code formatting tools.
