\subsection*{\doxygenRule{}}

A doxygen comment block used for documenting a function shall include the /brief command. The text for this command shall be a short, preferably one-line, description capturing the core functionality. The command shall be followed by an empty line.

\subsubsection*{Examples}

\noindent
\begin{minipage}[t]{0.47\textwidth}
    \lstinputlisting[
        xleftmargin=3.4pt,
        firstline=6,
        lastline=16,
        title={Non-Compliant}
    ]{../code/doxy-rule-002-non-compliant.c}
\end{minipage}\hfill
\begin{minipage}[t]{0.47\textwidth}
    \lstinputlisting[
        firstline=6,
        lastline=16,
        title={Compliant}
    ]{../code/doxy-rule-002-compliant.c}
\end{minipage}

\subsubsection*{Reasoning}

 Most functions worthy of a Doxygen comment block deserve at least one line of documentation, describing its functionality and purpose. The /brief command is meant to be used for this type of short, concise, documentation. An empty line following the /brief command is by Doxygen interpreted as a new paragraph. More detailed description can optionally be inserted after the empty line.
